  <p>The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an architecture and software framework
    for creating, discovering, composing and deploying a broad range of multi-modal analysis capabilities and
    integrating them with search technologies.  The architecture is undergoing a standardization effort, 
    referred to as the <span class="emphasis"><em>UIMA specification</em></span> by a technical committee within
    <a class="ulink" href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=uima" target="_top">OASIS</a>.  
    </p>
  
  <p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Apache UIMA</em></span> framework is an Apache licensed, open source implementation of the
    UIMA Architecture, and provides a run-time environment in which developers can plug in
    and run their UIMA component implementations and with which they can build and deploy UIM applications. The
    framework itself is not specific to any IDE or platform.</p>
  
  <p>It includes an all-Java implementation of the
    UIMA framework for the development, description, composition and deployment of UIMA components and
    applications. It also provides the developer with an Eclipse-based (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_top">http://www.eclipse.org/</a>
    ) development environment that includes a set of tools and utilities for using UIMA. It also includes 
    a C++ version of the framework, and
    enablements for Annotators built in Perl, Python, and TCL.</p>
  
  <p>This chapter is the intended starting point for readers that are new to the Apache UIMA Project. It includes
    this introduction and the following sections:</p>

    The first 2 parts make up this book; the last 3 have individual 
    books.  The books are provided both as
    (somewhat large) html files, viewable in browsers, and also as PDF files.  
    The documentation is fully hyperlinked, with tables of contents.  The PDF versions are set up to 
    print nicely - they have page numbers included on the cross references within a book. </p>
    
    <p>If you view the PDF files inside
    a browser that supports imbedded viewing of PDF, the hyperlinks between different PDF books may work (not 
    all browsers have been tested...).</p>
    
    <p>The following set of tables gives a more detailed overview of the various parts of the
    documentation.

    <p> There are two previous version of UIMA, available from IBM's alphaWorks: version 1.4.x and version 2.0
      (the 2.0 version was a "beta" only release). This section describes the changes relative to both of these
      releases. A migration utility is provided which updates your Java code and descriptors as needed for this
      release. See <a class="xref" href="#ugr.project_overview_migrating_from_ibm_uima" title="1.4.&nbsp;Migrating from IBM UIMA to Apache UIMA">Section&nbsp;1.4, &#8220;Migrating from IBM UIMA to Apache UIMA&#8221;</a> for instructions on how to

     <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Each Apache UIMA release includes RELEASE_NOTES and RELEASE_NOTES.html files that
        describe the changes that have occurred in each release.
        Please refer to those files for specific changes for each Apache UIMA release.</p></div>

    <p>This section describes what has changed between version 2.0 and version 2.1 of UIMA;
      the following section describes the differences between version 1.4 and version 2.1.
      </p>
    
      <div class="section" title="1.3.1.1.&nbsp;Java Package Name Changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="ugr.project_overview.migration_utility.java_package_name_changes">1.3.1.1.&nbsp;Java Package Name Changes</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>All of the UIMA Java package names have changed in Apache UIMA. They now start with
          <code class="literal">org.apache</code> rather than <code class="literal">com.ibm</code>. There have been other
          changes as well. The package name segment <code class="literal">reference_impl</code> has been shortened to
          <code class="literal">impl</code>, and some segments have been reordered. For example
          <code class="literal">com.ibm.uima.reference_impl.analysis_engine</code> has become
          <code class="literal">org.apache.uima.analysis_engine.impl</code>. Tools are now consolidated under
          <code class="literal">org.apache.uima.tools</code> and service adapters under
          <code class="literal">org.apache.uima.adapter</code>. </p>
        <p>The migration utility will replace all occurrences of IBM UIMA package names with their Apache UIMA
          equivalents. It will not replace <span class="emphasis"><em>prefixes</em></span> of package names, so if your code uses
          a package called <code class="literal">com.ibm.uima.myproject</code> (although that is not recommended), it
          will not be replaced.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section" title="1.3.1.2.&nbsp;XML Descriptor Changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="ugr.project_overview.migration_utility.xml_descriptor_changes">1.3.1.2.&nbsp;XML Descriptor Changes</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>The XML namespace in UIMA component descriptors has changed from
          <code class="literal">http://uima.watson.ibm.com/resourceSpecifier</code> to
          <code class="literal">http://uima.apache.org/resourceSpecifier</code>. The value of the
          <code class="literal">&lt;frameworkImplementation&gt;</code> must now be
          <code class="literal">org.apache.uima.java</code> or <code class="literal">org.apache.uima.cpp</code>. The
          migration script will apply these replacements. </p>
      </div>

        <p>In Apache UIMA the <code class="literal">TCAS</code> interface has been removed. All uses of it must now be
          replaced by the <code class="literal">CAS</code> interface. (All methods that used to be defined on
          <code class="literal">TCAS</code> were moved to <code class="literal">CAS</code> in v2.0.) The method
          <code class="literal">CAS.getTCAS()</code> is replaced with <code class="literal">CAS.getCurrentView()</code> and
          <code class="literal">CAS.getTCAS(String)</code> is replaced with <code class="literal">CAS.getView(String)</code>
          . The following have also been removed and replaced with the equivalent "CAS" variants:
          <code class="literal">TCASException</code>, <code class="literal">TCASRuntimeException</code>,
          <code class="literal">TCasPool</code>, and <code class="literal">CasCreationUtils.createTCas(...)</code>. </p>
        <p>The migration script will apply the necessary replacements.</p>

        <p>In previous versions, user code accessed the JCas <span class="emphasis"><em>class</em></span> directly. In Apache
          UIMA there is now an interface, <code class="literal">org.apache.uima.jcas.JCas</code>, which all JCas-based
          user code must now use. Static methods that were previously on the JCas class (and called from JCas cover
          classes generated by JCasGen) have been moved to the new
          <code class="literal">org.apache.uima.jcas.JCasRegistry</code> class. The migration script will apply the
          necessary replacements to your code, including any JCas cover classes that are part of your codebase.

        <p>The UIMA JAR file names have changed slightly.  Underscores have been replaced with hyphens to 
          be consistent with Apache naming conventions.  For example <code class="literal">uima_core.jar</code> is now 
          <code class="literal">uima-core.jar</code>.  Also <code class="literal">uima_jcas_builtin_types.jar</code> has been 
          renamed to <code class="literal">uima-document-annotation.jar</code>.  Finally, the <code class="literal">jVinci.jar</code> 
          file is now in the <code class="literal">lib</code> directory rather than the <code class="literal">lib/vinci</code> 
          directory as was previously the case.  The migration script will apply the necessary replacements,
          for example to script files or Eclipse launch configurations.

        <b>Simpler Analysis Engines and CASes.&nbsp;</b>
        Version 1.x made a distinction between Analysis Engines and Text Analysis
          Engines. This distinction has been eliminated in Version 2 - new code should just
          refer to Analysis Engines. Analysis Engines can operate on multiple kinds of
          artifacts, including text.

        Analysis Components, in general, can make use of new capabilities to return
          multiple new CASes, in addition to returning the original CAS that is passed in.
          This allows components to have Collection Reader-like capabilities, but be

      <p title="New additional Annotator API ImplBase">
        <b>New additional Annotator API ImplBase.&nbsp;</b>
        
          As of version 2.1, UIMA has a new set of Annotator interfaces. Annotators should now 
          extend CasAnnotator_ImplBase or JCasAnnotator_ImplBase instead of the v1.x 
          TextAnnotator_ImplBase and JTextAnnotator_ImplBase.  The v1.x annotator 
          interfaces are unchanged and are still supported for backwards compatibility.
         
        </p>
      <p>      
        The new Annotator interfaces support the changed approaches for ResultSpecifications
        and the changed exception names (see below), and have all the methods that CAS Consumers
      have, including CollectionProcessComplete and BatchProcessComplete.</p>
  
    <p title="UIMA Exceptions rationalized"><a name="ugr.ovv.exceptions_rationalized"></a>
      <b>UIMA Exceptions rationalized.&nbsp;</b>
      
      In version 1 there were different exceptions for the methods of an
        AnalysisEngine and for the corresponding methods of an Annotator; these were merged
        in version 2.

          For Annotators that extend the previous base, the previous definition of typeSystemInit will continue to 
          work for backwards compatibility.
       </p></div>

    
    <p title="Changes in Result Specifications"><a name="ugr.ovv.result_specification"></a>
      <b>Changes in Result Specifications.&nbsp;</b>
      In version 1, the <code class="literal">process(...)</code> method took a second
        argument, a ResultSpecification. Now it is set when changed and it's up to the
        annotator to store it in a local field and make it available when needed.  
        This approach lets the annotator receive a specific signal (a method call) when
        the Result Specification changes. Previously, it would need to check on every call to
        see if it changed. The default impl base classes provide set/getResultSpecification(...)
        methods for this
    </p>
    
    <p title="Only one Capability Set"><a name="ugr.ovv.one_capability_set"></a>
      <b>Only one Capability Set.&nbsp;</b>
      In version one, you can define 
        multiple capability sets. These were not supported well, and for version two, 
        this is now simplified - you should only use one capability set. 
        (For backwards compatibility, if you use more, 
        this won't cause a problem for now).
    </p>
    
    
      <p title="TextAnalysisEngine deprecated; use AnalysisEngine instead">
        <b>TextAnalysisEngine deprecated; use AnalysisEngine instead.&nbsp;</b>
      TextAnalysisEngine has been deprecated - it is now no different than
        AnalysisEngine. Previous code that uses this should still continue to work,
        however.</p>
      
      <p title="Annotator Context deprecated; use UimaContext instead">
        <b>Annotator Context deprecated; use UimaContext instead.&nbsp;</b>
        The context for the Annotator is the same as the overall UIMA context. 
        The impl base classes provide a getContext() method which returns now the 
        UimaContext object.
      </p>
      
      <p title="DocumentAnalyzer tool uses XMI formats">
        <b>DocumentAnalyzer tool uses XMI formats.&nbsp;</b>
      The DocumentAnalyzer tool saves outputs in the new XMI serialization format.
        The AnnotationViewer and SemanticSearchGUI tools can read both the new XMI format
        and the previous XCAS format.</p>
      
      <p title="CAS Initializer deprecated">

      <p>Other than the changes from IBM UIMA to Apache UIMA described above, most UIMA 1.x
        applications should not require additional changes to upgrade to UIMA 2.x. However,

    <p>In Apache UIMA, several things have changed that require changes to user code and descriptors.
      A migration utility is provided which will make the required updates to your files.  The most
      significant change is that the Java package names for all of the UIMA classes and interfaces have changed 
      from what they were in IBM UIMA; all of the package names now start with the prefix <code class="literal">org.apache</code>.</p>
    
    <div class="section" title="1.4.1.&nbsp;Running the Migration Utility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ugr.project_overview_running_the_migration_utility">1.4.1.&nbsp;Running the Migration Utility</h3></div></div></div>
       
      <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p>Before running the migration utility, be sure to back up your files, just in case you encounter any
        problems, because the migration tool updates the files in place in the directories where it finds them.</p> 
      </div>
      <p> The migration utility is run by executing the script file
        <code class="literal">apache-uima/bin/ibmUimaToApacheUima.bat</code> (Windows) or
        <code class="literal">apache-uima/bin/ibmUimaToApacheUima.sh</code> (UNIX). You must pass one argument: the
        directory containing the files that you want to be migrated. Subdirectories will be processed
        recursively.</p>

      <p>The script scans your files and applies the necessary updates, for example replacing the com.ibm
        package names with the new org.apache package names. For more details on what has changed in the UIMA APIs and
        what changes are performed by the migration script, see <a class="xref" href="#ugr.project_overview_changes_from_2_0" title="1.3.1.&nbsp;Changes from IBM UIMA 2.0 to Apache UIMA 2.1">Section&nbsp;1.3.1, &#8220;Changes from IBM UIMA 2.0 to Apache UIMA 2.1&#8221;</a>.</p>
      
      <p>The script will only attempt to modify files with the extensions: java, xml, xmi, wsdd, properties,
        launch, bat, cmd, sh, ksh, or csh; and files with no extension. Also, files with size greater than 1,000,000
        bytes will be skipped. (If you want the script to modify files with other extensions, you can edit the script
        file and change the <code class="literal">-ext</code> argument appropriately.) </p>
      
      <p>If the migration tool reports warnings, there may be a few additional steps to take.  The following two
        sections explain some simple manual changes that you might need to make to your code.</p>

      <div class="section" title="1.4.1.1.&nbsp;JCas Cover Classes for DocumentAnnotation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="ugr.project_overview_running_the_migration_utility.jcas_for_document_annotation">1.4.1.1.&nbsp;JCas Cover Classes for DocumentAnnotation</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p> If you have run JCasGen it is likely that you have the classes
          <code class="literal">com.ibm.uima.jcas.tcas.DocumentAnnotation</code> and
          <code class="literal">com.ibm.uima.jcas.tcas.DocumentAnnotation_Type</code> as part of your code. This
          package name is no longer valid, and the migration utility does not move your files between directories so
          it is unable to fix this. </p>
        <p> If you have not made manual modifications to these classes, the best solution is usually to just delete
          these two classes (and their containing package). There is a default version in the
          <code class="literal">uima-document-annotation.jar</code> file that is included in Apache UIMA. If you
          <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> made custom changes, then you should not delete the file but instead move it to
          the correct package <code class="literal">org.apache.uima.jcas.tcas</code>. For more information about JCas
          and DocumentAnnotation please see <a href="references.html#ugr.ref.jcas.documentannotation_issues" class="olink">Section&nbsp;5.5.4, &#8220;Adding Features to DocumentAnnotation&#8221;</a> </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section" title="1.4.1.2.&nbsp;JCas.getDocumentAnnotation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="ugr.project_overview_running_the_migration_utility.manual_migration_needed.getdocumentannotation">1.4.1.2.&nbsp;JCas.getDocumentAnnotation</h4></div></div></div>
        
        <p>The deprecated method <code class="literal">JCas.getDocumentAnnotation</code> has been removed. Its use
          must be replaced with <code class="literal">JCas.getDocumentAnnotationFs</code>. The method
          <code class="literal">JCas.getDocumentAnnotationFs()</code> returns type <code class="literal">TOP</code>, so your
          code must cast this to type <code class="literal">DocumentAnnotation</code>. The reasons for this are described
          in <a href="references.html#ugr.ref.jcas.documentannotation_issues" class="olink">Section&nbsp;5.5.4, &#8220;Adding Features to DocumentAnnotation&#8221;</a>.

      <p>The following are rare cases where you may need to take additional steps to migrate your code.  You need only 
        read this section if the migration tool reported a warning or if you are having trouble getting your code to 
        compile or run after running the migration.  For most users, attention to these things will not
        be required.</p>

        <p>The use of &lt;xi:include&gt; in UIMA component descriptors has been discouraged for some time, and in
          Apache UIMA support for it has been removed. If you have descriptors that use that, you must change them to
          use UIMA's &lt;import&gt; syntax instead. The proper syntax is described in <a href="references.html#ugr.ref.xml.component_descriptor.imports" class="olink">Section&nbsp;2.2, &#8220;Imports&#8221;</a>.

        <p>Because <code class="literal">TCAS</code> has been replaced by <code class="literal">CAS</code>, if you had two
          methods distinguished only by whether an argument type was <code class="literal">TCAS</code> or
          <code class="literal">CAS</code>, the migration tool will cause these to have identical signatures, which will be
          a compile error. If this happens, consider why the two variants were needed in the first place. Often, it may
          work to simply delete one of the methods.</p>

      <div class="section" title="1.4.2.3.&nbsp;Use of Undocumented Methods from the com.ibm.uima.util package"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="ugr.project_overview.manual_migration_needed.undocumented_methods">1.4.2.3.&nbsp;Use of Undocumented Methods from the com.ibm.uima.util package</h4></div></div></div>
        
        
        <p>Previous UIMA versions has some methods in the <code class="literal">com.ibm.uima.util</code> package that
          were for internal use and were not documented in the Javadoc. (There are also many methods in that package
          which are documented, and there is no issue with using these.) It is not recommended that you use any of the
          undocumented methods. If you do, the migration script will not handle them correctly. These have now been
          moved to <code class="literal">org.apache.uima.internal.util</code>, and you will have to manually update your

        <p>If you have placed your own classes in a package that has exactly the same name as one of the UIMA packages
          (not recommended), this will cause problems when your run the migration script. Since the script replaces
          UIMA package names, all of your imports that refer to your class will get replaced and your code will no
          longer compile. If this happens, you can fix it by manually moving your code to the new Apache UIMA package
          name (i.e., whatever name your imports got replaced with). However, we recommend instead that you do not
          use Apache UIMA package names for your own code.</p>
        <p>An even more rare case would be if you had a package name that started with a capital letter (poor Java
          style) AND was prefixed by one of the UIMA package names, for example a package named
          <code class="literal">com.ibm.uima.MyPackage</code>. This would be treated as a class name and replaced with
          <code class="literal">org.apache.uima.MyPackage</code> wherever it occurs.</p>

        <p>
          This change may affect user code to a small extent, as some of the APIs on 
          <code class="literal">CASException</code> and <code class="literal">CASRuntimeException</code> no longer exist.
          On the up side, all UIMA exceptions are now derived from the same base classes and behave
          the same way.  The most significant change is that you can no longer check for the specific
          type of exception the way you used to.  For example, if you had code like this:
          
          </p><pre class="programlisting">catch (CASRuntimeException e) {
  if (e.getError() == CASRuntimeException.ILLEGAL_ARRAY_SIZE) {
  // Do something in case this particular error is caught</pre><p>
          
          you will need to replace it with the following:
          
          </p><pre class="programlisting">catch (CASRuntimeException e) {
  if (e.getMessageKey().equals(CASRuntimeException.ILLEGAL_ARRAY_SIZE)) {
  // Do something in case this particular error is caught</pre><p>
          
          as the message keys are now strings.  This change is not handled by the migration script.

      <p>UIMA supports the development, discovery, composition and deployment of multi-modal
        analytics for the analysis of unstructured information and its integration with search
        technologies.</p>
      
      <p>Apache UIMA includes APIs and tools for creating analysis components. Examples of analysis components include
        tokenizers, summarizers, categorizers, parsers, named-entity detectors etc. Tutorial examples are
        provided with Apache UIMA; additional components are available from the community. </p>
      
      <p>Apache UIMA does not itself include a semantic search engine; instructions are included for 
        incorporating the semantic search SDK from IBM's <a class="ulink" href="http://alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/uima" target="_top">alphaWorks</a>

      <p>The Apache UIMA project is both a Java framework and a matching C++
        enablement layer, which allows annotators to be written in C++ and have access to a C++ version of the CAS. The
        C++ enablement layer also enables annotators to be written in Perl, Python, and TCL, and to interoperate with
        those written in other languages.

  <p>UIMA is an open, industrial-strength, scaleable and extensible platform for
    creating, integrating and deploying unstructured information management solutions
    from powerful text or multi-modal analysis and search components. </p>
  
  <p>The Apache UIMA project is an implementation of the Java UIMA framework available
    under the Apache License, providing a common foundation for industry and academia to
    collaborate and accelerate the world-wide development of technologies critical for
    discovering vital knowledge present in the fastest growing sources of information
    today.</p>
  
  <p>This chapter presents an introduction to many essential UIMA concepts. It is meant to
    provide a broad overview to give the reader a quick sense of UIMA's basic
    architectural philosophy and the UIMA SDK's capabilities. </p>
  
  <p>This chapter provides a general orientation to UIMA and makes liberal reference to
    the other chapters in the UIMA SDK documentation set, where the reader may find detailed
    treatments of key concepts and development practices. It may be useful to refer to <a href="overview_and_setup.html#ugr.glossary" class="olink">Glossary</a>, to become familiar
    with the terminology in this overview.</p>

    </div><p class="title"><b>Figure&nbsp;2.1.&nbsp;UIMA helps you build the bridge between the unstructured and structured
        worlds</b></p></div><br class="figure-break">
    
    <p> Unstructured information represents the largest, most current and fastest
      growing source of information available to businesses and governments. The web is just
      the tip of the iceberg. Consider the mounds of information hosted in the enterprise and
      around the world and across different media including text, voice and video. The
      high-value content in these vast collections of unstructured information is,
      unfortunately, buried in lots of noise. Searching for what you need or doing
      sophisticated data mining over unstructured information sources presents new
      challenges. </p>
    
    <p>An unstructured information management (UIM) application may be generally
      characterized as a software system that analyzes large volumes of unstructured
      information (text, audio, video, images, etc.) to discover, organize and deliver
      relevant knowledge to the client or application end-user. An example is an application
      that processes millions of medical abstracts to discover critical drug interactions.
      Another example is an application that processes tens of millions of documents to
      discover key evidence indicating probable competitive threats. </p>
    
    <p>First and foremost, the unstructured data must be analyzed to interpret, detect
      and locate concepts of interest, for example, named entities like persons,
      organizations, locations, facilities, products etc., that are not explicitly tagged
      or annotated in the original artifact. More challenging analytics may detect things
      like opinions, complaints, threats or facts. And then there are relations, for
      example, located in, finances, supports, purchases, repairs etc. The list of concepts 
      important for applications to discover in unstructured content is large, varied and 
      often domain specific. 
      Many different component analytics may solve different parts of the overall analysis task. 
      These component analytics must interoperate and must be easily combined to facilitate 
      the developed of UIM applications.</p>
    
    <p>The result of analysis are used to populate structured forms so that conventional 
      data processing and search technologies 
      like search engines, database engines or OLAP
      (On-Line Analytical Processing, or Data Mining) engines 
      can efficiently deliver the newly discovered content in response to the client requests 
      or queries.</p>
    
    <p>In analyzing unstructured content, UIM applications make use of a variety of
      analysis technologies including:</p>
    
    <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc" compact><li class="listitem"><p>Statistical and rule-based Natural Language Processing
        (NLP)</p>
      </li><li class="listitem"><p>Information Retrieval (IR)</p>
      </li><li class="listitem"><p>Machine learning</p>

      </li><li class="listitem"><p>Knowledge Sources (e.g., CYC, WordNet, FrameNet, etc.)</p>
      </li></ul></div>
    
    <p>Specific analysis capabilities using these technologies are developed 
      independently using different techniques, interfaces and platforms.
      </p>
    
    <p>The bridge from the unstructured world to the structured world is built through the
      composition and deployment of these analysis capabilities. This integration is often
      a costly challenge. </p>
    
    <p>The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an architecture
      and software framework that helps you build that bridge. It supports creating,
      discovering, composing and deploying a broad range of analysis capabilities and
      linking them to structured information services.</p>
    
    <p>UIMA allows development teams to match the right skills with the right parts of a
      solution and helps enable rapid integration across technologies and platforms using a
      variety of different deployment options. These ranging from tightly-coupled
      deployments for high-performance, single-machine, embedded solutions to parallel
      and fully distributed deployments for highly flexible and scaleable
      solutions.</p>

    <p>UIMA is a software architecture which specifies component interfaces, data
      representations, design patterns and development roles for creating, describing,
      discovering, composing and deploying multi-modal analysis capabilities.</p>
    
    <p>The <span class="bold"><strong>UIMA framework</strong></span> provides a run-time
      environment in which developers can plug in their UIMA component implementations and
      with which they can build and deploy UIM applications. The framework is not specific to
      any IDE or platform. Apache hosts a Java and (soon) a C++ implementation of the UIMA
      Framework.</p>
    
    <p>The <span class="bold"><strong>UIMA Software Development Kit (SDK)</strong></span>
      includes the UIMA framework, plus tools and utilities for using UIMA. Some of the
      tooling supports an Eclipse-based ( <a class="ulink" href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_top">http://www.eclipse.org/</a>)

      <p>UIMA is an architecture in which basic building blocks called Analysis Engines
        (AEs) are composed to analyze a document and infer and record descriptive attributes
        about the document as a whole, and/or about regions therein. This descriptive
        information, produced by AEs is referred to generally as <span class="bold"><strong>
        analysis results</strong></span>. Analysis results typically represent meta-data
        about the document content. One way to think about AEs is as software agents that
        automatically discover and record meta-data about original content.</p>
      
      <p>UIMA supports the analysis of different modalities including text, audio and
        video. The majority of examples we provide are for text. We use the term <span class="bold"><strong>document, </strong></span>therefore, to generally refer to any unit of
        content that an AE may process, whether it is a text document or a segment of audio, for
        example. See the section <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.mvs" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Multiple CAS Views of an Artifact</i></a> for more information on multimodal processing
        in UIMA.</p>
      
      <p>Analysis results include different statements about the content of a document.
        For example, the following is an assertion about the topic of a document:</p>
      
      
      <pre class="programlisting">(1) The Topic of document D102 is "CEOs and Golf".</pre>
      
      <p>Analysis results may include statements describing regions more granular than
        the entire document. We use the term <span class="bold"><strong>span</strong></span> to
        refer to a sequence of characters in a text document. Consider that a document with the
        identifier D102 contains a span, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Fred Centers</span>&#8221;</span> starting at
        character position 101. An AE that can detect persons in text may represent the
        following statement as an analysis result:</p>
      
      
      <pre class="programlisting">(2) The span from position 101 to 112 in document D102 denotes a Person</pre>
      
      <p>In both statements 1 and 2 above there is a special pre-defined term or what we call
        in UIMA a <span class="bold"><strong>Type</strong></span>. They are
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Topic</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Person</em></span> respectively.
        UIMA types characterize the kinds of results that an AE may create &#8211; more on
        types later.</p>
      
      <p>Other analysis results may relate two statements. For example, an AE might
        record in its results that two spans are both referring to the same person:</p>
      
      
      <pre class="programlisting">(3) The Person denoted by span 101 to 112 and 
  the Person denoted by span 141 to 143 in document D102 
  refer to the same Entity.</pre>
      
      <p>The above statements are some examples of the kinds of results that AEs may record
        to describe the content of the documents they analyze. These are not meant to indicate
        the form or syntax with which these results are captured in UIMA &#8211; more on that
        later in this overview.</p>
      
      <p>The UIMA framework treats Analysis engines as pluggable, composible,
        discoverable, managed objects. At the heart of AEs are the analysis algorithms that
        do all the work to analyze documents and record analysis results. </p>
      
      <p>UIMA provides a basic component type intended to house the core analysis
        algorithms running inside AEs. Instances of this component are called <span class="bold"><strong>Annotators</strong></span>. The analysis algorithm developer's
        primary concern therefore is the development of annotators. The UIMA framework
        provides the necessary methods for taking annotators and creating analysis
        engines.</p>
      
      <p>In UIMA the person who codes analysis algorithms takes on the role of the
          <span class="bold"><strong>Annotator Developer</strong></span>. <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.aae" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;1, <i>Annotator and Analysis Engine Developer's Guide</i></a> will take the reader
        through the details involved in creating UIMA annotators and analysis
        engines.</p>
      
      <p>At the most primitive level an AE wraps an annotator adding the necessary APIs and
        infrastructure for the composition and deployment of annotators within the UIMA
        framework. The simplest AE contains exactly one annotator at its core. Complex AEs
        may contain a collection of other AEs each potentially containing within them other
        AEs. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section" title="2.3.2.&nbsp;Representing Analysis Results in the CAS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ugr.ovv.conceptual.representing_results_in_cas">2.3.2.&nbsp;Representing Analysis Results in the CAS</h3></div></div></div>
      
      
      <p>How annotators represent and share their results is an important part of the UIMA
        architecture. UIMA defines a <span class="bold"><strong>Common Analysis Structure
        (CAS)</strong></span> precisely for these purposes.</p>
      
      <p>The CAS is an object-based data structure that allows the representation of
        objects, properties and values. Object types may be related to each other in a
        single-inheritance hierarchy. The CAS logically (if not physically) contains the
        document being analyzed. Analysis developers share and record their analysis
        results in terms of an object model within the CAS. <sup>[<a name="d5e754" href="#ftn.d5e754" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup> </p>
      
      <p>The UIMA framework includes an implementation and interfaces to the CAS. For a
        more detailed description of the CAS and its interfaces see <a href="references.html#ugr.ref.cas" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;4, <i>CAS Reference</i></a>.</p>
      
      <p>A CAS that logically contains statement 2 (repeated here for your
        convenience)</p>
      
      
      <pre class="programlisting">(2) The span from position 101 to 112 in document D102 denotes a Person</pre>
      
      <p>would include objects of the Person type. For each person found in the body of a
        document, the AE would create a Person object in the CAS and link it to the span of text
        where the person was mentioned in the document.</p>
      
      <p>While the CAS is a general purpose data structure, UIMA defines a
        few basic types and affords the developer the ability to extend these to define an
        arbitrarily rich <span class="bold"><strong>Type System</strong></span>. You can think of a
        type system as an object schema for the CAS.</p>
      
      <p>A type system defines the various types of objects that may be discovered in 
        documents by AE's that subscribe to that type system.</p>
      
      <p>As suggested above, Person may be defined as a type. Types have properties or
          <span class="bold"><strong>features</strong></span>. So for example,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Age</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Occupation</em></span> may be defined as
        features of the Person type.</p>
      
      <p>Other types might be <span class="emphasis"><em>Organization, Company, Bank, Facility, Money,
        Size, Price, Phone Number, Phone Call, Relation, Network Packet, Product, Noun
        Phrase, Verb, Color, Parse Node, Feature Weight Array</em></span> etc.</p>
      
      <p>There are no limits to the different types that may be defined in a type system. A
        type system is domain and application specific.</p>
      
      <p>Types in a UIMA type system may be organized into a taxonomy. For example,
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Company</em></span> may be defined as a subtype of
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Organization</em></span>. <span class="emphasis"><em>NounPhrase</em></span> may be a
        subtype of a <span class="emphasis"><em>ParseNode</em></span>.</p>
      
      <div class="section" title="2.3.2.1.&nbsp;The Annotation Type"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="ugr.ovv.conceptual.annotation_type">2.3.2.1.&nbsp;The Annotation Type</h4></div></div></div>
        
        
        <p>A general and common type used in artifact analysis and from which additional
          types are often derived is the <span class="bold"><strong>annotation</strong></span>
          type. </p>
        
        <p>The annotation type is used to annotate or label regions of an artifact. Common
          artifacts are text documents, but they can be other things, such as audio streams.
          The annotation type for text includes two features, namely
          <span class="emphasis"><em>begin</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>end</em></span>. Values of these
          features represent integer offsets in the artifact and delimit a span. Any
          particular annotation object identifies the span it annotates with the
          <span class="emphasis"><em>begin</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>end</em></span> features.</p>
        
        <p>The key idea here is that the annotation type is used to identify and label or
          <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">annotate</span>&#8221;</span> a specific region of an artifact.</p>
        
        <p>Consider that the Person type is defined as a subtype of annotation. An
          annotator, for example, can create a Person annotation to record the discovery of a
          mention of a person between position 141 and 143 in document D102. The annotator can
          create another person annotation to record the detection of a mention of a person in
          the span between positions 101 and 112. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section" title="2.3.2.2.&nbsp;Not Just Annotations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="ugr.ovv.conceptual.not_just_annotations">2.3.2.2.&nbsp;Not Just Annotations</h4></div></div></div>
        
        
        <p>While the annotation type is a useful type for annotating regions of a
          document, annotations are not the only kind of types in a CAS. A CAS is a general
          representation scheme and may store arbitrary data structures to represent the
          analysis of documents.</p>
        
        <p>As an example, consider statement 3 above (repeated here for your
          convenience).</p>
        
        
        <pre class="programlisting">(3) The Person denoted by span 101 to 112 and 
  the Person denoted by span 141 to 143 in document D102 
  refer to the same Entity.</pre>
        
        <p>This statement mentions two person annotations in the CAS; the first, call it
          P1 delimiting the span from 101 to 112 and the other, call it P2, delimiting the span
          from 141 to 143. Statement 3 asserts explicitly that these two spans refer to the
          same entity. This means that while there are two expressions in the text
          represented by the annotations P1 and P2, each refers to one and the same person.
          </p>
        
        <p>The Entity type may be introduced into a type system to capture this kind of
          information. The Entity type is not an annotation. It is intended to represent an
          object in the domain which may be referred to by different expressions (or
          mentions) occurring multiple times within a document (or across documents within
          a collection of documents). The Entity type has a feature named
          <span class="emphasis"><em>occurrences. </em></span>This feature is used to point to all the
          annotations believed to label mentions of the same entity.</p>
        
        <p>Consider that the spans annotated by P1 and P2 were <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Fred
          Center</span>&#8221;</span> and <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">He</span>&#8221;</span> respectively. The annotator might create
          a new Entity object called
          <code class="code">FredCenter</code>. To represent the relationship in statement 3 above,
          the annotator may link FredCenter to both P1 and P2 by making them values of its
          <span class="emphasis"><em>occurrences</em></span> feature.</p>
        
        <p> <a class="xref" href="#ugr.ovv.conceptual.metadata_in_cas" title="Figure&nbsp;2.2.&nbsp;Objects represented in the Common Analysis Structure (CAS)">Figure&nbsp;2.2, &#8220;Objects represented in the Common Analysis Structure (CAS)&#8221;</a> also
          illustrates that an entity may be linked to annotations referring to regions of
          image documents as well. To do this the annotation type would have to be extended
          with the appropriate features to point to regions of an image.</p>

      <div class="section" title="2.3.2.3.&nbsp;Multiple Views within a CAS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="ugr.ovv.conceptual.multiple_views_within_a_cas">2.3.2.3.&nbsp;Multiple Views within a CAS</h4></div></div></div>
        
        
        <p>UIMA supports the simultaneous analysis of multiple views of a document. This
          support comes in handy for processing multiple forms of the artifact, for example, the audio
          and the closed captioned views of a single speech stream, or the tagged and detagged 
          views of an HTML document.</p>
        
        <p>AEs analyze one or more views of a document. Each view contains a specific
            <span class="bold"><strong>subject of analysis(Sofa)</strong></span>, plus a set of
          indexes holding metadata indexed by that view. The CAS, overall, holds one or more
          CAS Views, plus the descriptive objects that represent the analysis results for
          each. </p>
        
        <p>Another common example of using CAS Views is for different translations of a
          document. Each translation may be represented with a different CAS View. Each
          translation may be described by a different set of analysis results. For more
          details on CAS Views and Sofas see <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.mvs" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;6, <i>Multiple CAS Views of an Artifact</i></a> and <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.aas" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;5, <i>Annotations, Artifacts, and Sofas</i></a>. </p>

    <div class="section" title="2.3.3.&nbsp;Interacting with the CAS and External Resources"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ugr.ovv.conceptual.interacting_with_cas_and_external_resources">2.3.3.&nbsp;Interacting with the CAS and External Resources</h3></div></div></div>
      
      
      
      <p>The two main interfaces that a UIMA component developer interacts with are the
        CAS and the UIMA Context.</p>
      
      <p>UIMA provides an efficient implementation of the CAS with multiple programming
        interfaces. Through these interfaces, the annotator developer interacts with the
        document and reads and writes analysis results. The CAS interfaces provide a suite of
        access methods that allow the developer to obtain indexed iterators to the different
        objects in the CAS. See <a href="references.html#ugr.ref.cas" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;4, <i>CAS Reference</i></a>. While many objects may exist in a CAS, the annotator
        developer can obtain a specialized iterator to all Person objects associated with a
        particular view, for example.</p>
      
      <p>For Java annotator developers, UIMA provides the JCas. This interface provides
        the Java developer with a natural interface to CAS objects. Each type declared in the
        type system appears as a Java Class; the UIMA framework renders the Person type as a
        Person class in Java. As the analysis algorithm detects mentions of persons in the
        documents, it can create Person objects in the CAS. For more details on how to interact
        with the CAS using this interface, refer to <a href="references.html#ugr.ref.jcas" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;5, <i>JCas Reference</i></a>.</p>
      
      <p>The component developer, in addition to interacting with the CAS, can access
        external resources through the framework's resource manager interface
        called the <span class="bold"><strong>UIMA Context</strong></span>. This interface, among
        other things, can ensure that different annotators working together in an aggregate
        flow may share the same instance of an external file or remote resource accessed
        via its URL, for example. For details on using
        the UIMA Context see <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.aae" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;1, <i>Annotator and Analysis Engine Developer's Guide</i></a>.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="section" title="2.3.4.&nbsp;Component Descriptors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ugr.ovv.conceptual.component_descriptors">2.3.4.&nbsp;Component Descriptors</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>UIMA defines interfaces for a small set of core components that users of the
        framework provide implmentations for. Annotators and Analysis Engines are two of
        the basic building blocks specified by the architecture. Developers implement them
        to build and compose analysis capabilities and ultimately applications.</p>
      
      <p>There are others components in addition to these, which we will learn about
        later, but for every component specified in UIMA there are two parts required for its
        implementation:</p>
      
      <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1" compact><li class="listitem"><p>the declarative part and</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the code part.</p></li></ol></div>
      
      <p>The declarative part contains metadata describing the component, its
        identity, structure and behavior and is called the <span class="bold"><strong>
        Component Descriptor</strong></span>. Component descriptors are represented in XML.
        The code part implements the algorithm. The code part may be a program in Java.</p>
      
      <p>As a developer using the UIMA SDK, to implement a UIMA component it is always the
        case that you will provide two things: the code part and the Component Descriptor.
        Note that when you are composing an engine, the code may be already provided in
        reusable subcomponents. In these cases you may not be developing new code but rather
        composing an aggregate engine by pointing to other components where the code has been
        included.</p>
      
      <p>Component descriptors are represented in XML and aid in component discovery,
        reuse, composition and development tooling. The UIMA SDK provides tools for easily
        creating and maintaining the component descriptors that relieve the developer from
        editing XML directly. This tool is described briefly in <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.aae" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;1, <i>Annotator and Analysis Engine Developer's Guide</i></a>, and more
        thoroughly in <a href="tools.html#ugr.tools.cde" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;1, <i>Component Descriptor Editor User's Guide</i></a>
        .</p>
      
      <p>Component descriptors contain standard metadata including the
        component's name, author, version, and a reference to the class that
        implements the component.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to these standard fields, a component descriptor identifies the
        type system the component uses and the types it requires in an input CAS and the types it
        plans to produce in an output CAS.</p>
      
      <p>For example, an AE that detects person types may require as input a CAS that
        includes a tokenization and deep parse of the document. The descriptor refers to a
        type system to make the component's input requirements and output types
        explicit. In effect, the descriptor includes a declarative description of the
        component's behavior and can be used to aid in component discovery and
        composition based on desired results. UIMA analysis engines provide an interface
        for accessing the component metadata represented in their descriptors. For more
        details on the structure of UIMA component descriptors refer to <a href="references.html#ugr.ref.xml.component_descriptor" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Component Descriptor Reference</i></a>.</p>

    <p>A simple or primitive UIMA Analysis Engine (AE) contains a single annotator. AEs,
      however, may be defined to contain other AEs organized in a workflow. These more complex
      analysis engines are called <span class="bold"><strong>Aggregate Analysis
      Engines.</strong></span> </p>
    
    <p>Annotators tend to perform fairly granular functions, for example language
      detection, tokenization or part of speech detection. 
    These functions typically address just part of an overall analysis task. A workflow 
      of component engines may be orchestrated to perform more complex tasks.</p>
    
    <p>An AE that performs named entity detection, for example, may
      include a pipeline of annotators starting with language detection feeding
      tokenization, then part-of-speech detection, then deep grammatical parsing and then
      finally named-entity detection. Each step in the pipeline is required by the
      subsequent analysis. For example, the final named-entity annotator can only do its
      analysis if the previous deep grammatical parse was recorded in the CAS.</p>
    
    <p>Aggregate AEs are built to encapsulate potentially complex internal structure
      and insulate it from users of the AE. In our example, the aggregate analysis engine
      developer acquires the internal components, defines the necessary flow
      between them and publishes the resulting AE. Consider the simple example illustrated
      in <a class="xref" href="#ugr.ovv.conceptual.sample_aggregate" title="Figure&nbsp;2.3.&nbsp;Sample Aggregate Analysis Engine">Figure&nbsp;2.3, &#8220;Sample Aggregate Analysis Engine&#8221;</a> where
      <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">MyNamed-EntityDetector</span>&#8221;</span> is composed of a linear flow of more
      primitive analysis engines.</p>
    
    <p>Users of this AE need not know how it is constructed internally but only need its name
      and its published input requirements and output types. These must be declared in the
      aggregate AE's descriptor. Aggregate AE's descriptors declare the components
      they contain and a <span class="bold"><strong>flow specification</strong></span>. The flow
      specification defines the order in which the internal component AEs should be run. The
      internal AEs specified in an aggregate are also called the <span class="bold"><strong>
      delegate analysis engines.</strong></span> The term "delegate" is used because aggregate AE's 
      are thought to "delegate" functions to their internal AEs.</p>
    
    <p>
      In UIMA 2.0, the developer can implement a "Flow Controller" and include it as part 
      of an aggregate AE by referring to it in the aggregate AE's descriptor. 
      The flow controller is responsible for computing the "flow", that is, 
      for determining the order in which of delegate AE's that will process the CAS. 
      The Flow Contoller has access to the CAS and any external resources it may require 
      for determining the flow. It can do this dynamically at run-time, it can 
      make multi-step decisions and it can consider any sort of flow specification 
      included in the aggregate AE's descriptor. See 
      <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.fc" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;4, <i>Flow Controller Developer's Guide</i></a> 
      for details on the UIMA Flow Controller interface.
    </p>
    
    <p>We refer to the development role associated with building an aggregate from
      delegate AEs as the <span class="bold"><strong>Analysis Engine Assembler</strong></span>
      .</p>
    
    <p>The UIMA framework, given an aggregate analysis engine descriptor, will run all
      delegate AEs, ensuring that each one gets access to the CAS in the sequence produced by
      the flow controller. The UIMA framework is equipped to handle different
      deployments where the delegate engines, for example, are <span class="bold"><strong>
      tightly-coupled</strong></span> (running in the same process) or <span class="bold"><strong>
      loosely-coupled</strong></span> (running in separate processes or even on different
      machines). The framework supports a number of remote protocols for loose coupling
      deployments of aggregate analysis engines, including SOAP (which stands for Simple
      Object Access Protocol, a standard Web Services communications protocol).</p>
    
    <p>The UIMA framework facilitates the deployment of AEs as remote services by using an
      adapter layer that automatically creates the necessary infrastructure in response to
      a declaration in the component's descriptor. For more details on creating
      aggregate analysis engines refer to <a href="references.html#ugr.ref.xml.component_descriptor" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Component Descriptor Reference</i></a> The component descriptor editor tool
      assists in the specification of aggregate AEs from a repository of available engines.
      For more details on this tool refer to <a href="tools.html#ugr.tools.cde" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;1, <i>Component Descriptor Editor User's Guide</i></a>.</p>
    
    <p>The UIMA framework implementation has two built-in flow implementations: one
      that support a linear flow between components, and one with conditional branching
      based on the language of the document. It also supports user-provided flow
      controllers, as described in <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.fc" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;4, <i>Flow Controller Developer's Guide</i></a>. Furthermore, the application developer is
      free to create multiple AEs and provide their own logic to combine the AEs in arbitrarily
      complex flows. For more details on this the reader may refer to <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.application.using_aes" class="olink">Section&nbsp;3.2, &#8220;Using Analysis Engines&#8221;</a>.</p>

      <p>As mentioned above, the basic AE interface may be thought of as simply CAS in/CAS
        out.</p>
      
      <p>The application is responsible for interacting with the UIMA framework to
        instantiate an AE, create or acquire an input CAS, initialize the input CAS with a
        document and then pass it to the AE through the <span class="bold"><strong>process

      <p>The UIMA AE Factory takes the declarative information from the Component
        Descriptor and the class files implementing the annotator, and instantiates the AE
        instance, setting up the CAS and the UIMA Context.</p>
      
      <p>The AE, possibly calling many delegate AEs internally, performs the overall
        analysis and its process method returns the CAS containing new analysis results.
        </p>
      
      <p>The application then decides what to do with the returned CAS. There are many
        possibilities. For instance the application could: display the results, store the

        or database application etc.</p>
      
      <p>The UIMA framework provides methods to support the application developer in

      <p>Many UIM applications analyze entire collections of documents. They connect to
        different document sources and do different things with the results. But in the
        typical case, the application must generally follow these logical steps:
        
        </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1" compact><li class="listitem"><p>Connect to a physical source</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Acquire a document from the source</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Initialize a CAS with the document to be analyzed</p>

      <p>UIMA supports UIM application development for this general type of processing
        through its <span class="bold"><strong>Collection Processing
        Architecture</strong></span>.</p>
      
      <p>As part of the collection processing architecture UIMA introduces two primary
        components in addition to the annotator and analysis engine. These are the <span class="bold"><strong>Collection Reader</strong></span> and the <span class="bold"><strong>CAS
        Consumer</strong></span>. The complete flow from source, through document analysis,
        and to CAS Consumers supported by UIMA is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#ugr.ovv.conceptual.fig.cpe" title="Figure&nbsp;2.5.&nbsp;High-Level UIMA Component Architecture from Source to Sink">Figure&nbsp;2.5, &#8220;High-Level UIMA Component Architecture from Source to Sink&#8221;</a>.</p>
      
      <p>The Collection Reader's job is to connect to and iterate through a source
        collection, acquiring documents and initializing CASes for analysis. </p>
      
      
      
      <p>CAS Consumers, as the name suggests, function at the end of the flow. Their job is
        to do the final CAS processing. A CAS Consumer may be implemented, for example, to
        index CAS contents in a search engine, extract elements of interest and populate a
        relational database or serialize and store analysis results to disk for subsequent
        and further analysis. </p>
      
      <p>A Semantic Search engine that works with UIMA is available from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/uima" target="_top">IBM's alphaWorks
        site</a> which will allow the developer to experiment with indexing analysis
        results and querying for documents based on all the annotations in the CAS. See the
        section on integrating text analysis and search in <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.application" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;3, <i>Application Developer's Guide</i></a>.</p>
      
      <p>A UIMA <span class="bold"><strong>Collection Processing Engine</strong></span> (CPE)
        is an aggregate component that specifies a <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">source to sink</span>&#8221;</span> flow from a
        Collection Reader though a set of analysis engines and then to a set of CAS Consumers.
        </p>
      
      <p>CPEs are specified by XML files called CPE Descriptors. These are declarative
        specifications that point to their contained components (Collection Readers,
        analysis engines and CAS Consumers) and indicate a flow among them. The flow
        specification allows for filtering capabilities to, for example, skip over AEs
        based on CAS contents. Details about the format of CPE Descriptors may be found in

      <p>The UIMA framework includes a <span class="bold"><strong>Collection Processing
        Manager</strong></span> (CPM). The CPM is capable of reading a CPE descriptor, and
        deploying and running the specified CPE. <a class="xref" href="#ugr.ovv.conceptual.fig.cpe" title="Figure&nbsp;2.5.&nbsp;High-Level UIMA Component Architecture from Source to Sink">Figure&nbsp;2.5, &#8220;High-Level UIMA Component Architecture from Source to Sink&#8221;</a> illustrates the role of the CPM
        in the UIMA Framework.</p>
      
      <p>Key features of the CPM are failure recovery, CAS management and scale-out.
        </p>
      
      <p>Collections may be large and take considerable time to analyze. A configurable
        behavior of the CPM is to log faults on single document failures while continuing to
        process the collection. This behavior is commonly used because analysis components
        often tend to be the weakest link -- in practice they may choke on strangely formatted
        content. </p>
      
      <p>This deployment option requires that the CPM run in a separate process or a
        machine distinct from the CPE components. A CPE may be configured to run with a variety
        of deployment options that control the features provided by the CPM. For details see
          <a href="references.html#ugr.ref.xml.cpe_descriptor" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;3, <i>Collection Processing Engine Descriptor Reference</i></a>
        .</p>
      
      <p>The UIMA SDK also provides a tool called the CPE Configurator. This tool provides
        the developer with a user interface that simplifies the process of connecting up all
        the components in a CPE and running the result. For details on using the CPE
        Configurator see <a href="tools.html#ugr.tools.cpe" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Collection Processing Engine Configurator User's Guide</i></a>. This tool currently does not provide
        access to the full set of CPE deployment options supported by the CPM; however, you can
        configure other parts of the CPE descriptor by editing it directly. For details on how
        to create and run CPEs refer to <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.cpe" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Collection Processing Engine Developer's Guide</i></a>.</p>

      <p>In a simple UIMA Collection Processing Engine (CPE), a Collection Reader reads
        documents from the file system and initializes CASs with their content. These are
        then fed to an AE that annotates tokens and sentences, the CASs, now enriched with
        token and sentence information, are passed to a CAS Consumer that populates a search
        engine index. </p>
      
      <p>The search engine query processor can then use the token index to provide basic
        key-word search. For example, given a query <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">center</span>&#8221;</span> the search
        engine would return all the documents that contained the word
        <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">center</span>&#8221;</span>.</p>
      
      <p><span class="bold"><strong>Semantic Search</strong></span> is a search paradigm that
        can exploit the additional metadata generated by analytics like a UIMA CPE.</p>
      
      <p>Consider that we plugged a named-entity recognizer into the CPE described
        above. Assume this analysis engine is capable of detecting in documents and
        annotating in the CAS mentions of persons and organizations.</p>
      
      <p>Complementing the name-entity recognizer we add a CAS Consumer that extracts in
        addition to token and sentence annotations, the person and organizations added to
        the CASs by the name-entity detector. It then feeds these into the semantic search
        engine's index.</p>
      
      <p>The semantic search engine that comes with the UIMA SDK, for example, can exploit
        this addition information from the CAS to support more powerful queries. For
        example, imagine a user is looking for documents that mention an organization with
        <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">center</span>&#8221;</span> it is name but is not sure of the full or precise name of the
        organization. A key-word search on <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">center</span>&#8221;</span> would likely produce way
        too many documents because <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">center</span>&#8221;</span> is a common and ambiguous term.
        The semantic search engine that is available from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/uima" target="_top">http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/uima</a> supports a query language
        called <span class="bold"><strong>XML Fragments</strong></span>. This query language is
        designed to exploit the CAS annotations entered in its index. The XML Fragment query,
        for example,
        
        
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;organization&gt; center &lt;/organization&gt;</pre><p>
        will produce first only documents that contain <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">center</span>&#8221;</span> where it
        appears as part of a mention annotated as an organization by the name-entity
        recognizer. This will likely be a much shorter list of documents more precisely
        matching the user's interest.</p>
      
      <p>Consider taking this one step further. We add a relationship recognizer that
        annotates mentions of the CEO-of relationship. We configure the CAS Consumer so that
        it sends these new relationship annotations to the semantic search index as well.
        With these additional analysis results in the index we can submit queries like
        
        
        </p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;ceo_of&gt;
    &lt;person&gt; center &lt;/person&gt;
    &lt;organization&gt; center &lt;/organization&gt;
&lt;ceo_of&gt;</pre><p>
        This query will precisely target documents that contain a mention of an organization
        with <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">center</span>&#8221;</span> as part of its name where that organization is mentioned
        as part of a
        <code class="code">CEO-of</code> relationship annotated by the relationship
        recognizer.</p>

      <p>Search engine indices are not the only place to deposit analysis results for use
        by applications. Another classic example is populating databases. While many
        approaches are possible with varying degrees of flexibly and performance all are
        highly dependent on application specifics. We included a simple sample CAS Consumer
        that provides the basics for getting your analysis result into a relational
        database. It extracts annotations from a CAS and writes them to a relational
        database, using the open source Apache Derby database.</p>

    <p>In previous sections we've seen how the CAS is initialized with an initial
      artifact that will be subsequently analyzed by Analysis engines and CAS Consumers. The
      first Analysis engine may make some assertions about the artifact, for example, in the
      form of annotations. Subsequent Analysis engines will make further assertions about
      both the artifact and previous analysis results, and finally one or more CAS Consumers
      will extract information from these CASs for structured information storage.</p>

      analyzing an audio subject of analysis, and later analysis engines are analyzing a text
      subject of analysis. The CAS Consumer will likely want to build a search index from
      concepts found in the text to the original audio segment covered by the concept.</p>
    
    <p>What becomes clear from this relatively simple scenario is that the CAS must be
      capable of simultaneously holding multiple subjects of analysis. Some analysis
      engine will analyze only one subject of analysis, some will analyze one and create
      another, and some will need to access multiple subjects of analysis at the same time.

      of the same audio segment). A Sofa may
      be associated with CAS Views. A particular CAS will have one or more views, each view
      corresponding to a particular subject of analysis, together with a set of the defined
      indexes that index the metadata created in that view.</p>
    
    <p>Analysis results can be indexed in, or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">belong</span>&#8221;</span> to, a specific view.
      UIMA components may be written in <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Multi-View</span>&#8221;</span> mode - able to create and
      access multiple Sofas at the same time, or in <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Single-View</span>&#8221;</span> mode, simply
      receiving a particular view of the CAS corresponding to a particular single Sofa. For
      single-view mode components, it is up to the person assembling the component to supply
      the needed information to insure a particular view is passed to the component at run
      time. This is done using XML descriptors for Sofa mapping (see <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.mvs.sofa_name_mapping" class="olink">Section&nbsp;6.4, &#8220;Sofa Name Mapping&#8221;</a>).</p>
    
    <p>Multi-View capability brings benefits to text-only processing as well. An input
      document can be transformed from one format to another. Examples of this include
      transforming text from HTML to plain text or from one natural language to another.

  <p>This chapter describes how to set up the UIMA SDK to work with Eclipse. Eclipse (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="_top">http://www.eclipse.org</a>) is a popular open-source Integrated Development
    Environment for many things, including Java. The UIMA SDK does not require that you use
    Eclipse. However, we recommend that you do use Eclipse because some useful UIMA SDK tools
    run as plug-ins to the Eclipse platform and because the UIMA SDK examples are provided in a
    form that's easy to import into your Eclipse environment.</p>
  
  <p>If you are not planning on using the UIMA SDK with Eclipse, you may skip this chapter and
    read <a href="tutorials_and_users_guides.html#ugr.tug.aae" class="olink">Chapter&nbsp;1, <i>Annotator and Analysis Engine Developer's Guide</i></a>
    next.</p>

        </li></ul></div>
  
  <p>The UIMA Eclipse plugins are designed to be used with Eclipse version 3.1 or
    later.
  </p>
  
  <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>You will need to run Eclipse using a Java at the 1.5 or later level, in order

        use.</p></li></ul></div>
      
      <p>The first time Eclipse starts up it will take a bit longer as it completes its
        installation. A <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">welcome</span>&#8221;</span> page will come up. After you are through

      <p>The best way to do this is to use the Eclipse Update mechanism, because that will 
        insure that all needed prerequisites are also installed.  See below for an alternative,
        manual approach.</p>
      
        <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>If your computer is on an internet connection which uses a proxy server, you can
        configure Eclipse to know about that. Put your proxy settings into Eclipse using the
        Eclipse preferences by accessing the menus: Window <span class="symbol">&#8594;</span> Preferences... <span class="symbol">&#8594;</span>
        Install/Update, and Enable HTTP proxy connection under the Proxy Settings with the
        information about your proxy. </p></div>

      
      <p>To use the Eclipse Update mechanism, start Eclipse, and then pick the menu 
        <span class="command"><strong>Help <span class="symbol">&#8594;</span> Software Updates <span class="symbol">&#8594;</span> Find and Install...</strong></span>.
      On the next page, select the option to Search for new features to install, and press the
        <span class="command"><strong>Next</strong></span> button.  On the next panel, update sites to visit, press the "Add a new
        remote site" button and enter the URL 
        http://www.apache.org/dist/uima/eclipse-update-site, and press OK.  On the previous
        page will now appear this new Site, and it should be checked.</p>
      
      <p>Also check the Europa (or Callisto) 
        Discovery Site, which is where the EMF core plugins are (EMF stands for Eclipse Modeling Framework; 
        it is an add-on to Eclipse, and is used
        by some of the UIMA Eclipse tooling).</p>
      <p>Now click finish, and follow the 
        remaining panels to install the UIMA plugins.  If
        you do not have a compatible level of EMF installed, when you select the UIMA plugins, you will get a
        message saying it needs EMF.  To add EMF to the list of plugins to be downloaded, just expand the
        Discovery Site entry by clicking it's little "plus" sign and then push the "Select Required" button on the right
        of the panel.  This will select the part of EMF that is needed.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section" title="3.1.3.&nbsp;Manual Install additional Eclipse component: EMF"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="ugr.ovv.eclipse_setup.install_emf">3.1.3.&nbsp;Manual Install additional Eclipse component: EMF</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>You can skip this section if you installed EMF using the above process.</p>
      
      <div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>EMF comes in many versions; <span class="bold"><strong>you must install
      the version that corresponds to the level of Eclipse that you are running.</strong></span>
      This is automatically done for you if you install it using the Eclipse update mechanism,
      described below. If you separately download an EMF package, you will need to verify it is
      the version that corresponds to the level of Eclipse you are running, before installing
      it.</p></div>
      
      <p>Before installing EMF using these instructions, please go to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf" target="_top">http://www.eclipse.org/emf</a> and read the installation instructions, and then click on the
        "Update Manager" link to see what url to use in the next step, where you use the built-in
        facilities in Eclipse to find and install new features. </p>
      
      <p> The exact way to install EMF changes from time to time. In the next few paragraphs,
        we try to give instructions that should work for most versions. Please see the end of
        this section for shortcut instructions for the current version of Eclipse at the time
        of this writing, Eclipse 3.3. </p>
      
      <p>Activate the software feature finding by using the menu: Help <span class="symbol">&#8594;</span> Software
        Updates <span class="symbol">&#8594;</span> Find and Install. Select <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Search for new features to
        install</span>&#8221;</span>, push <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Next</span>&#8221;</span>. Specify the update sites to use to
        search for EMF, making sure the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Ignore features not applicable to this
        environment</span>&#8221;</span> box is checked (at the bottom of the dialog), and push
        <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Finish</span>&#8221;</span>. A good site to use is one of the Discovery Sites (e.g. Callisto or Europa) - which has a
        collection of Eclipse components including EMF. </p>
            
      <p>This will launch a search for updates to Eclipse; it may show a list of update site
        mirrors &#8211; click OK. When it finishes, it shows a list of possible updates in an
        expandable tree. Expand the tree nodes to find EMF SDK. The specific level may vary
        from the level shown below as newer versions are released.</p>

      </div>
      
      <p>Click <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Next</span>&#8221;</span>. Then pick Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), and
        push <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Next</span>&#8221;</span>, accept any licensing agreements, etc., until it
        finishes the installation. It may say it's an <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">unsigned feature</span>&#8221;</span>;
        proceed by clicking <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Install</span>&#8221;</span>. If it recommends restarting, you may
        do that.</p>
      
      <p>This will install EMF, without any extras. (If you want the whole EMF system,
        including source and documentation, you can pick the <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">EMF SDK</span>&#8221;</span> and the
        <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Examples for Eclipse Modeling Framework</span>&#8221;</span>.)</p>

        <p>Since Eclipse 3.2, all major Eclipse sub-projects coordinate their
          release timeframes and publish the consolidated releases. The code name
          for 3.2 was Callisto, the one for 3.3 is Europa.  You can
          easily install EMF via the release discovery site as follows.

          <a class="ulink" href="http://incubator.apache.org/uima" target="_top">http://incubator.apache.org/uima</a>.  Be sure to set the environmental variable
          UIMA_HOME pointing to the root of the installed UIMA SDK and run the
          <code class="literal">adjustExamplePaths.bat</code> or <code class="literal">adjustExamplePaths.sh</code>
          script, as explained in the README.</p>

      <p>The environmental parameter UIMA_HOME is used by the command-line scripts in the

          Architecture. It is component software architecture for the development,
          discovery, composition and deployment of multi-modal analytics for the analysis
          of unstructured information.</p>
          <p>UIMA processing occurs through a series of modules called 
            <a class="link" href="#ugr.faqs.annotator_versus_ae">analysis engines</a>. The result of analysis is an assignment of semantics to the elements of
            unstructured data, for example, the indication that the phrase
            <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Washington</span>&#8221;</span> refers to a person's name or that it refers to a
            place.</p>
          
          <p>Analysis Engine's output can be saved in conventional structures,
            for example, relational databases or search engine indices, where the content
            of the original unstructured information may be efficiently accessed
            according to its inferred semantics. </p>
          
          <p>UIMA supports developers in creating,
            integrating, and deploying components across platforms and among dispersed
            teams working to develop unstructured information management
            applications.</p>

          <p>Apache UIMA is an open source, Apache-licensed software project,
            currently undergoing incubation at Apache.org.  It includes run-time
            frameworks in Java and C++, APIs and tools for implementing, composing, packaging
            and deploying UIMA components.</p>
          
          <p>The UIMA run-time framework allows developers to plug-in their components
            and applications and run them on different platforms and according to different
            deployment options that range from tightly-coupled (running in the same
            process space) to loosely-coupled (distributed across different processes or
            machines for greater scale, flexibility and recoverability).</p>

          The Apache UIMA project does not itself include a semantic search engine.  
          It can interface with the semantic search engine
            component (available from <a class="ulink" href="www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/uima" target="_top">www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/uima</a> for indexing and querying over
            the results of analysis. Over time, we expect that additional search engines will
            add support for semantic searching.

          <p>An example is the label <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Person</span>&#8221;</span> associated with the span of
            text <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">George Washington</span>&#8221;</span>. We say that <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Person</span>&#8221;</span>

            Washington was the first president of the United States</span>&#8221;</span>. The
            association of the label
            <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Person</span>&#8221;</span> with a particular span of text is an annotation. Another
            example may have an annotation represent a topic, like <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">American
            Presidents</span>&#8221;</span> and be used to label an entire document.</p>
          
          <p>Annotations are not limited to regions of texts. An annotation may annotate

          example links between annotations and properties of objects associated with
          annotations.</p>

          can be done via an XML or a binary serialization of the CAS. </p>

          given a document it may have different translations, each of which are associated

          CAS may have multiple Views, each containing a different Subject of Analysis
          corresponding to some version of the original artifact. This feature is ideal for
          multi-modal analysis, where for example, one view of a video stream may be the video

          analyzes documents and outputs <a class="link" href="#ugr.faqs.what_is_an_annotation">annotations</a> on the content of the documents. The
          UIMA framework takes the annotator, together with metadata describing such
          things as the input requirements and outputs types of the annotator, and produces
          an analysis engine. </p>
          
          <p>Analysis Engines contain the framework-provided infrastructure that
            allows them to be easily combined with other analysis engines in different flows
            and according to different deployment options (collocated or as web services,
            for example). </p>
          
          <p>Analysis Engines are the framework-generated objects that an Application
            interacts with. An Annotator is a user-written class that implements the one of

          component includes an
          <code class="code">operationalProperties</code> element which can specify if multiple
          deployment is allowed. If true, then a particular instance of an Engine might not
          see all the CASes being processed. If false, then that component will see all of the
          CASes being processed. In this case, it can accumulate state information among all
          the CASes. Typically, Analysis Engines in the main analysis pipeline are marked
          multipleDeploymentAllowed = true. The CAS Consumer component, on the other hand,
          defaults to having this property set to false, and is typically associated with
          some resource like a database or search engine that aggregates analysis results
          across an entire collection.</p>
          
          <p>Analysis Engines developers are encouraged not to maintain state between

          and tools provided by WebSphere for achieving scalability, service management,

          components orchestrated to analyze a large collection of documents. The UIMA
          developer does not implement or describe a CPM. It is a piece of infrastructure code

            Engine(s) and CAS Consumers. These components are organized in a work flow and
            define a collection analysis job or CPE. A CPE acquires documents from a source
            collection, initializes CASs with document content, performs document
            analysis and then produces collection level results (e.g., search engine
            index, database etc). The CPM is the execution engine for a CPE.</p>

          perform analysis on text documents and generate semantics in the form of

          <span class="command"><strong>first</strong></span> will return all documents that contain that word.
          <span class="command"><strong>First</strong></span> is a frequent and ambiguous term &#8211; it occurs a lot
          and can mean different things in different places. If the user is looking for
          organizations that contain that word <span class="command"><strong>first</strong></span> in their names,
          s/he will likely have to sift through lots of documents containing the word
          <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">first</span>&#8221;</span> used in different ways. Semantic Search exploits the
          results of analysis to allow more precise queries. For example, the semantic
          search query <span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;organization&gt; first
          &lt;/organization&gt;</em></span> will rank first documents that contain the
          word <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">first</span>&#8221;</span> as part of the name of an organization. The UIMA SDK
          documentation demonstrates how UIMA applications can be built using semantic
          search. It provides details about the XML Fragment Query language. This is the
          particular query language used by the semantic search engine that comes with the
          SDK.</p></dd><dt><a name="ugr.faqs.xml_fragment_not_xml"></a><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Is an XML Fragment Query valid XML?</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>Not necessarily. The XML Fragment Query syntax is used to formulate
          queries interpreted by the semantic search engine that ships with the UIMA SDK.
          This query language relies on basic XML syntax as an intuitive way to describe
          hierarchical patterns of annotations that may occur in a <a class="link" href="#ugr.faqs.what_is_the_cas">CAS</a>. The language
          deviates from valid XML in order to support queries over
          <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">overlapping</span>&#8221;</span> or <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">cross-over</span>&#8221;</span> annotations and
          other features that affect the interpretation of the query by the query processor.
          For example, it admits notations in the query to indicate whether a keyword or an
          annotation is optional or required to match a document.</p></dd><dt><a name="ugr.faqs.modalities_other_than_text"></a><span class="term"><span class="bold"><strong>Does UIMA support modalities other than text?</strong></span></span></dt><dd><p>The UIMA architecture supports the development, discovery,

an audio file could be the original artifact, and also be one Sofa, and another

          <a class="glossterm" href="#ugr.glossary.feature"><em class="glossterm">Feature</em></a>s, which are attributes, or

          of one Analysis Engine to be read as input by another Analysis Engine.
A type system is roughly analogous to a set of related classes in object
