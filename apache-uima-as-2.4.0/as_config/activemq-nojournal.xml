          Broker optimizations for better performance:
          1) optimizedDispatch="true" - use a single thread per JMS Session. This setting instructs
             AMQ to use a transport thread to deliver messages to JMS Listener. By default two threads
             are used: Transport thread and a Session thread. This optimization yields the best 
             performance gain.
             
          2) producerFlowControl="false" - instructs the AMQ to never slow down or block a producer

                     produceFlowControl="false" - don't block a fast producer.   

                     optimizedDispatch="true" - reduces number of broker threads. By default, the broker uses a dedicated 
                                                thread (for each Queue) to page messages from a message store into the 
                                                Queue to be dispatched to Message Consumers. When set to "true", the broker
                                                uses a thread pool to service all Queues.

                     maxPageSize="2000" - size of the dispatch buffer (default=200). The broker applies jms selectors
                                          to messages in this buffer only. If a consumer blocks, the producer may fill
                                          up the queue exceeding the size of the dispatch buffer. In such case, a GetMeta
                                          request will not be delivered to the consumer since it will not be in the dispatch
                                          buffer. This can cause GetMeta timeout in the application.
